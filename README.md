</p>
<main>
    <p>
        The exercise is about creating a mobile android client support for whatsapp using technologies like firebase (for cloud messaging and push notifications) and a full whatsapp web application involving login, register, chats pages and backend server with real-time communication using websockets.
        <br>
        The technologies used here is  HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, Bootstrap 5, Express, JWT, Mongoose, Socket.io, Android, Retrofit, Rooms and Firebase.
    </p>
    <h3>Running the application is done via the following:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>make sure that mongodb is running on the background.</li>
        <li>type in terminal <code>git clone https://github.com/toharka/Chat-Application.git</code>.</li>
        <li>type in terminal <code>cd Server</code> and run <code>npm i express cons express custom-env jsonwebtoken cors socket.io mongoose body-parser</code>.</li>
        <li>after all packages has being downloaded, run <code>npm start</code> to run the server on port <code>12345</code>.</li> 
        <li>run and check out project via an emulators (preferred to run with a relatively new android OS like Android 8.1 or above).</li>
        <li>register and login as a user.</li>  
    </ol>
<p>  **note: you must sign in from two diffrent dvieces to make the message sending work**  </p>
    <b>If you are on a linux machine, instead of running <code>npm start</code> on the server-side, run <code>npm run startLinux</code>.</b>
    <p>Good Luck!!</p>
